###### **Business of Syngene:**

*   Syngene is a 70.24% subsidiary of Biocon and accounts for one-third of the consolidated revenue and profit of Biocon.

• Syngene has a resilient, self-sustainable business model and has exhibited strong operating performance over the years.
• Proven track-record of over 25 years. Since it’s commencement of operations in 1994 with a seed capital of less than USD 0.5m, it has never raised equity to fund growth, and all capital investment plans were self-funded using its CFO & debt.
• EBITDA margins have been consistently around 30% over the last decade aided by economies of scale.
• Cost advantage of up to 50% compared to US and European competitors due to considerably lower manufacturing and employee costs together with favourable regulations.

###### **Growth prospects of the company:**

Syngene had robust revenue growth (double the pace of industry growth) and the management expects “low double-digit revenue growth for FY20-21”. (From Q2 con call transcript)

Syngene has exhibited strong operating performance, best in the industry. Syngene’s EBITDA increased at a 32% CAGR over FY11-16, and 16% CAGR over FY17-20 aided by economies of scale.

Syngene’s EBITDA margins have been consistently around 30% over the last decade, despite higher employee costs. This can be attributed to superior employee capacity utilization of 70-80% and higher gross margins relative to its peers.

###### **Competitor Analysis:**

• Syngene is the largest CRO + CDMO in India and second biggest in Asia after Wuxi Apptec.
• It has lower cost and higher valuation metrics compared to its APAC peer Wuxi. Syngene's billing rate in India per scientist is 60k USD whereas China’s per scientist rate is 90k-100k USD and Western Companies’ per scientist rate is 175k USD. (Hence India is cheaper in terms of costs to provide services)
• Increasing outsourcing trend (CRO/ CRAMS) in APAC region by large pharma companies and reducing dependence on China (China +1 strategy) will act as a tailwind for Syngene’s growth in upcoming years.
