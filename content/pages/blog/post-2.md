Investment decisions in any firm basically relate to the selection of assets in which funds will be invested by the firm. These assets broadly can fall into 2 groups:

1.  ***Long term Assets***, which yield a return over a period of time in the future,

*2. **Short-term or current assets***, which are convertible into cash without diminution in value, usually within a year.

The first of these involving the first category of assets is popularly known in financial literature as capital budgeting. The aspect of financial decision making with reference to current assets or short-term assets is popularly termed as working capital management.

Setting forth towards a framework for the financing decision of a firm, it is important to analyze the principles and types of *leverage*. A firm can make use of different sources of financing whose costs are different. The employment of an asset or source of funds for which the firm has to pay a fixed cost or fixed return may be termed as leverage.

In this article, we would be analyzing the nature of Investment and Financing decisions made by the top companies in the Cable Industry in India.

##### **SECTOR SNAPSHOT:**

The wires and cables market in India comprises nearly 40 percent of the electrical industry and is growing at a CAGR of *15 percent* as a result of growth in the power and infrastructure segments. Cable manufacturers, both power and telecom, have been shoring up their capacities in anticipation of the demand growth. The Transmission and Distribution sector continues to remain in focus, especially, with the outlay of Rs. 2.6 lakh crore announced by the Government for the 3-year period ending FY22. There is a sharper focus on high voltage transmission lines along with Government’s aims to provide 24×7 power, opening many opportunities.

##### **Capital Budgeting decisions — Wealth Maximization**

*Capital budgeting* involves choosing projects that add value to a company. The capital budgeting process can involve almost anything including acquiring land or purchasing fixed assets like a new truck or machinery. Corporations are typically required, or at least recommended, to undertake those projects which will **increase profitability** and thus **enhance shareholders’ wealth**. Businesses exist to earn profits. The capital budgeting process is a measurable way for businesses to determine the long-term economic and financial profitability of any investment project.

###### **Net Operating Revenue:**

Comparing the growth in Net operating revenue, Sterlite Technologies recorded the highest followed by KEI Industries. Sterlite Cables recorded a tremendous spike in their operating revenue (68% increases YOY) compared to the industry average (23.27%) followed by Birla cables (52% increase YOY).

Coming to sourcing of funds for capital budgeting decisions, no firms in the industry have gone for much Equity issues to raise funds. The firms have either used past cash reserves or have gone for *long term borrowings*. The Company which has gone for the highest borrowing is Sterlite Technologies, followed by KEI Industries. Other firms have tried to reduce their debts and hence used past reserves to fund their Capex projects.

##### **Leverage Analysis**

Leverage refers to the use of debt (borrowed funds) to amplify returns from an investment or project. Companies use leverage to finance their assets: instead of issuing stock to raise capital, companies can use debt to invest in business operations in an attempt to increase shareholder value.

###### **Degree of Operating Leverage(DOL):**

The degree of operating leverage (DOL) is a multiple that measures how much the operating income of a company will change in response to a change in sales. It is calculated by the following formula:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/531/1\*4Ek7VwHUoswe8z-uZV37vg.png)

High operating leverage indicates the firm has a large proportion of fixed costs, which means that a big increase in sales can lead to outsized changes in profits.

The cable industry’s average for taking operating risks is 1.425. The most volatile firm seems to be Birla Cables with operating leverage of more than 3, which is more than double. The least risk-taking firms in terms of operating expenses will be Finolex Cables.

Precision Wires seems very volatile in its decisions of taking operating risks. It has changed its risk-taking capacities drastically in the last three years. Though in its case, the risk-taking has proved fruitful as there has been growth in sales and EBIT all three years. The firms taking adequate operating risks KEI Industries and Salzer electronics. Each company has its operating leverage around the industry average and the ideal values. If asked to choose the better one, KEI cables have shown better growth in Revenues and EBIT. Birla has shown good growth potentials after taking high risks. Though Universal and Sterlite Technologies seems similar, based on EBITS, Sterlite Technologies has performed better than Universal.

###### **Degree of Financial Leverage (DFL):**

The degree of financial leverage (DFL) is a leverage ratio that measures the sensitivity of a company’s earnings per share to fluctuations in its operating income, as a result of changes in its capital structure. It is calculated by the following formula:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/479/1\*Z95ljLpE3inWivmqw47g3A.png)
The cable industry’s average for Financial leverage is 1.04. The highest takers of Financial risks are Birla Cables, Salzer Electronics and Precision Wires. However, the debt amount of these companies is very negligible compared to other firms in the same industry.

Based on the financial risk-taking capacities of the firm and their translation into higher EPS, Sterlite and KEI Industries come on top. The bottom firms will be Finolex and Universal cables having negative impacts on EPS due to financial risk takings. Birla Cables, Salzer Electronics and Precision Cables come in between. Finolex Cables has almost zero borrowings and thus no financial leverage. One reason for this may be because they have not indulged in any capital expenditure in the last two years. Thus, they maintain their levels of high EPS and MPS as there is no increase in fixed costs as well.

##### **Working Capital Management**

Working capital management is a business strategy designed to ensure that a company operates efficiently by monitoring and using its current assets and liabilities to the best effect. The primary purpose of working capital management is to enable the company to maintain enough cash flow to meet its short-term operating costs and short-term debt obligations.

We can calculate available working capital using the following formula:

*Working Capital = Accounts Receivable + Current Inventory -Accounts Payable*

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1344/1\*f6YFfn70uCuuAOGQrmrW_Q.png)

Positive working capital is required to ensure that a firm can continue its operations and that it has enough funds to satisfy both maturing short-term debt and upcoming operational expenses. The management of working capital involves managing inventories, accounts receivable and payable, and cash.

*Current assets and current liabilities include three accounts which are of special importance: accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.*

###### **Inventory Holding Period:**

To operate with maximum efficiency and maintain a comfortably high level of working capital, a company must keep enough inventory on hand to meet customers’ needs while avoiding unnecessary inventory that ties up working capital. It reveals how rapidly a company’s inventory is being sold and replenished. A relatively low period compared to industry peers indicates inventory levels are excessively high, while a relatively high value may indicate inadequate inventory levels.

###### **Receivables Collection Period:**

It provides the average number of days it takes a company to receive payment after a sales transaction on credit. If a company’s billing department is effective at collections attempts and customers pay their bills on time, the collection period will be lower. The lower a company’s collection period, the more efficient its cash flow.

###### **Creditors Payment Period:**

An indicator measures the average time it takes a company to settle its debts with trade suppliers (accounts payable). Thus, among other things, it gives information about payment habits and whether a business is taking full advantage of trade credit available.

*Operating cycle (in days) for top companies in Cable Industries*

Sterlite cable with the lowest NOC of -11 days in the industry, enjoys zero liquidity crunch and is able to get back all the receivables before the payment date comes up. Being the market leader, Sterlite cables enjoys a flexible credit period with its lenders at 85 days in 2018 and 117 days in 2019. its EBIT has gone up by 94% while EPS has gone up by 108% both are top in the industry and thus maximizes the wealth of the investors.

Precision wires have the lowest GOC in both the years. It had also reduced its GOC from 91 days in 2018 to 86 days in 2019. This indicates an efficient manufacturing cycle and is way below the industry average about 150 days. Its DIO of 1 month is well below the industry average of 2 months.

In 2018, Salzer had the worst GOC of 208 days, while Universal’s was 176 days. In 2019 Salzer had brought down its GOC by 14% to 178 days but Universal had increased its GOC to 208 days. The reason for the long GOC of Salzer was its very high DIO time of 113 days in 2018.
