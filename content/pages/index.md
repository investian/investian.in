          We were not taught financial literacy in school. The most important
          thing to realize is that when money is in good hands, it wants to stay
          & keep multiplying in those hands.

          I always thought if you looked at ten companies, you'd find one that's
          interesting, or if you look at hundred you'll find ten. The person
          that turns over the most rocks wins the game.
